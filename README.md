# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, secure, and responsive **personal portfolio website** built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional profile. This portfolio was developed as part of my **internship task at Arch Technologies** and reflects industry-level frontend practices, performance optimizations, and basic security considerations.

## 🔐 Security Practices Implemented

Although this is a frontend-focused portfolio, basic security best practices were considered:

* Input validation in contact form
* No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
* Safe handling of external links
* Clean separation of structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JS)

> ⚠️ Backend-level security (authentication, encryption, databases) is intentionally excluded as this is a frontend portfolio project.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible markup
* **CSS3** – Flexbox, Grid, animations, transitions
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation and interactivity
* **Boxicons** – Icons

> No heavy frameworks were used to keep bundle size minimal and performance high.
